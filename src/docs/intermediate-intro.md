
## Aim of this Guide

The objectives of this guide are to give you a quick overview of what cyber security is, why it’s important, and the basic steps you can take to keep yourself, your connections and the organisations you work for, safe from common threats.


----------
## Intro

### What is Cyber Security?
In layman's terms, cyber security is simply the measures put in place to protect your digital life. There are two key aspects of a good cyber security approach:

- **The technical side:** ensuring your digital life is secure and not easy for a hacker to exploit
- **The human side:** knowing how to spot, and how to deal with a data breach or hack

### Why does Cyber Security matter so much?
Quite simply because of the sheer volume of data on you and your activity which is collected and stored digitally. All this data may seem trivial and uninteresting, but it holds a high value, and in the wrong hands a lot of damage can be done.

### The Bigger Picture
It’s true that individuals are targets, but more often than not, criminals have their sights set on bigger things, usually exploiting the company or organisations you work for or are associated with. The weak point in any organisation is nearly always the people.

## Bottom Line Up Front
- A worryingly high proportion of individuals, and organisations have been, or will be hacked.
- The weak point in any computing system, is the humans (aka, you). This often puts yourself, your contacts and the organisation you work for at risk.
- A few very basic and simple steps, can make it significantly harder for a hacker to target you.
- Sometimes there is a trade off between security and convenience. It’s beneficial to understand the risks, in order to get the balance right.
