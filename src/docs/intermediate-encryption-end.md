*If your phone or computer is not encrypted, then all data stored on it can be readily available to a hacker, even if you have a strong password. Equally, if you donâ€™t make regular backups of important data, and anything happens to the original copy (such as ransomware, data corruption or just loosing or breaking a device), there may be no way of recovering it. Either with a cloud backup solution, (such as Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive), or locally with an external hard drive, USB pen, or NAS.*
